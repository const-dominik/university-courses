        The App Offline file (app_offline.htm) is used by the ASP.NET Core Module to shut down an app.

        If a file with the name app_offline.htm is detected in the root directory of an app, the ASP.NET Core Module attempts to gracefully shut down the app and stop processing incoming requests. If the app is still running after the number of seconds defined in shutdownTimeLimit, the ASP.NET Core Module stops the running process.

        While the app_offline.htm file is present, the ASP.NET Core Module responds to requests by sending back the contents of the app_offline.htm file. The app_offline.htm must be less than 4 GB. When the app_offline.htm file is removed, the next request starts the app.

        When using the out-of-process hosting model, the app might not shut down immediately if there's an open connection. For example, a WebSocket connection may delay app shut down..
